    "Lost in the darkness, I found you,\nMy darkness complements Your light,\nIn those shiny eye of yours,\nI've seen my demons disappear, you saved me.\nI'm intertwined in this love, forever yours.\nYour pictures breathe a new life into my lifeless self.\nYour voice is the sound of my peace.\nYour smile is always so fresh and new,\nBut your eyes, your eyes are the guiding lights that lead me to you.",
    "Oh I don't look good, she says,\nOh girl, don't you dare say.\nMy heart grows, my eyes shine,\nMy day is through and the night's alive.\nYou, you're the reason I've been where I am,\nStaring at your pics at 4 am.\nYou don't know the peace you provide,\nYour eyes are my best guide.\nGod gave me the perfect blessing that day.\nOh I don't look good, Please don't say.",
    "Texting a girl, A cute, beautiful girl.\nShe helps me, Annoys less.\nShe doubts herself, drowns in overthinking all the time.\nShe lightens my mood with just a smile [sometimes through her dory nature too].\nI don't know how much she means to me, and I don't want to know too.\n'Cause this cluelessness is cute, Just like u??"
